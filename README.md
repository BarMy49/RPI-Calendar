# RPI-Calendar

This is a simple calendar application that can be used to keep track of events and appointments. It is designed to 
be used on a Raspberry Pi with an e-ink display. The application is written in Python and uses a poprietary library 
to manage the display. The GUI will be modifiable by a flask app that will run on the Pi.
